# Rhythm Plus - Splamei Client (New - Mobile)
## If your looking for the Windows Client, find it [here](https://github.com/splamei/rplus-pc-client)
Another Splamei custom client for the [Rhythm Plus game](https://rhythm-plus.com) that now allows playing on Android

Rhythm Plus is a web-based vertical scrolling rhythm game (VSRG), you can make, play, and share any songs from and with anyone! The game can also be played on PC and other platforms with a working web-browser.
## Features

 - Native Android app
 - Easy to use
 - Notices for new info on Rhythm Plus
 - Alerts on new updates

## Compatibility
- The Android Version needs to be Android 8.0 Oreo or above (API Level 28+)
- Your device must also have the Android System WebView installed otherwise the client will crash
- Also you need an active internet connection and to be able to access the Rhythm Plus website (rhythm-plus.com) and the Splamei Network (veemo.uk)

## Installation

 - Downloaded the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/splamei/rplus-mobile-client/releases)
 - Open the APK file in the **file browser app that shipped with your device** as to protect from websites and apps installing malware
 - You might be prompted to allow the app to 'Install Unknown apps'. If so, enable it
 - Google Play Protect may want to scan the app. Allow it to scan because Play Protect will block the install otherwise. This shouldn't take long
 - The install should begin. The install should finish after a few seconds of the scan from Play Protect finishing
 - Find the app within your Android Launcher, open and allow notifications (used to alert you about notices and updates)
## Making your own client
If your using this code to make your own custom client whether that be for Rhythm Plus or another web app, I ask for you to please do the following:
 - Credit this client as the base (whether it be in the repo README or the app itself)
 - Replace or remove the update handling (and notice feature if you want)
 - Change the package name
 - If the client isn't for Rhythm Plus, please change the icons the client uses
 - Because this client is currently under the MIT Licence, you **must** acknowledge the copyright of the client and the MIT Licence. You do not have to place your client under the MIT Licence
## Contributing
I would love for people to help the clients development so any little contribution would go a long way!
You could contribute by:
 - Reporting issues / feature requests on the [issue page](https://github.com/splamei/rplus-mobile-client/issues)
 - Making forks of the repo
 - Making pull request to add code or fix bugs
 - Staring or watching the repo
 - Sharing the repo
## Troubleshooting
If the client fails, it may be down to the following:
- Your network connection isn't able to run or load Rhythm Plus
- Your device isn't able to run Rhythm Plus
- Your device doesn't have Android System WebView installed
- There is a bug / issue in the client

You may want to try the following to fix any issues:
- Restart the client / device
- Check your internet connection and that you can access Rhythm Plus
- Update all software and apps
- Clear the cache and data of the client
- Re-setup Android

This may not fix the issues, if so, please create a GitHub issue with the detains to help debugging.
## FAQ
### Q) Is the client available on the Play Store?
Currently, no. I do have plan to have it on the play store but that won't happen for at least a few years to allow to client to be in a usable state.
### Q) I have an older Android device then 8.0 Oreo. Can I still use the client?
No. Because the client uses functions that only work on SDK Version 28+, any older Android device won't be able to run it. Even if you tried. You may want to try the [legacy version](https://github.com/splamei/rhythm-plus-splamei-mobile-client) of the client but that won't be updated anymore.
### Q) Will the client come to other platforms? (Windows, MacOS, iOS, Linux)
The client is available for Windows and can be also found on [GitHub](https://github.com/splamei/rplus-pc-client) and might come to MacOS and Linux but not iOS since it would need to be sideloaded, which can only be done in the EU right now, and to get it on the App Store would require me to play ~$50 a year to Apple (which I don't want to do)
### Q) I want to make my own client. Can I do that?
Yes! Just make sure you follow everything stated in the 'Making your own Client' section
### Q) Is this client official?
No. But I am working on it!
